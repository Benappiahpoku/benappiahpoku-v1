From the busy streets of Osu to the vibrant Makola Market, small businesses in Ghana must adapt and be smart to survive. 




This guide shares practical, affordable tactics used by real small businesses to build loyal customer relationships, increase visibility (online and offline), and drive sales without expensive ad campaigns.




Each idea includes simple steps to implement today, real-world examples you can adapt, and free or cheap tools to maximize results.

The following ideas are designed especially for Ghanaian entrepreneurs. 




Each comes with practical steps and real-life examples to help you apply actions that work for your business today.

Real-Life Examples:





- If you run a small fashion business on Instagram, you could say, “Get GH₵10 off your first purchase.” It’s a small but thoughtful offer that can encourage someone to try your items for the first time.



- If you sell pastries or snacks, you can say, “Free delivery for first-time orders within East Legon.” This kind of offer makes it easier for new customers to place an order without hesitation.







Tool 4: Surprise Gifts with Orders




Action: Include unexpected small gifts with customer orders to delight them.​




Why It Works: Surprise gifts can enhance the customer experience and encourage repeat business.​




How to Do It:





- Select affordable, relevant items to include as gifts.​



- Personalise the gift when possible, to increase its impact.​




Real-Life Examples:





- Imagine you sell locally made jewellery. You could include a small thank-you card with every order or even a free earring or ring holder with each jewellery purchase.

Tool 5: Free Samples for New Customers




Action: Provide free samples of your products/services to potential new customers.​




Why It Works: Offering free samples or services can attract new customers by allowing them to try your product or service.

Real-Life Example:





- Imagine you sell homemade soaps. You could give out small samples at local markets or around your community—just a small piece of soap for people to try.



- If you sell snacks, you could offer small free samples of cupcakes at a busy palace such as a bus stop or market. 




Tool 6: Improve Customer Follow-Up





- Send thank-you messages after purchases



- Request customer feedback on WhatsApp or SMS







Idea 2: Be Found Where People Are Searching




Core Concept:If customers can’t find your business online, they won’t visit or buy.

Tool 1: Google Business Profile




Action: Register your business on Google Business Profile so that your shop shows up on Google Maps and in local search results.

Idea 4: Partner Locally, Grow Strategically




Core Concept:




Collaborate with other local businesses in Ghana to cross-promote each other's products or services. 




Such partnerships can expand your customer base, enhance brand visibility, and foster community engagement.​




What Can You Do?




Tool 1: Implement Cross-Promotion Strategies




Action: Develop mutual agreements with complementary businesses to promote each other. 




This can be achieved through various methods:​





- Flyer Exchange: Distribute each other's flyers at your respective business locations.​



- Social Media Shoutouts: Feature each other's products or services on your social media platforms.​



- Joint Discounts: Offer bundled discounts when customers purchase from both businesses. [ How to Increase Sales Through Cross-Promotion](https://startupmag.co.za/2024/12/how-to-increase-sales-through-cross-promotion-in-south-africa/)​



- Collaborative Events: Host events together to attract a broader audience.​

Action: Educate yourself on forming effective business partnerships. Understanding the principles of successful collaborations can lead to more fruitful outcomes.​




Real-Life Examples in Ghana





- Fashion and Accessories: A clothing boutique in Accra collaborates with a local jewellery maker. They display each other's products in their stores and promote them on social media.​



- Food and Delivery Services: A restaurant partners with a local delivery service. Customers ordering from the restaurant receive discounted delivery rates, benefiting both businesses.​



- Artisans and Markets: Local artisans team up with market vendors to showcase their crafts, attracting more customers to both stalls.​







Tips for Success in Joining Forces




Real-Life Example:Let’s say you make and sell meat pies and chips from your house. If there’s also a lady in your area who sells fresh fruit juice. You can





- Choose Complementary Partners:Your food and her drink go well together. You both sell to the same kind of people—like workers, students, or parents who want something quick to eat.



- Set Clear Objectives: You agree to help each other. When someone buys your meat pie, you tell them, “There’s nice fresh juice just down the road—go try it.” She also tells her juice buyers, “If you want something to eat with this, go and buy a meat pie from my friend.”



- Evaluate and Adapt: After one or two weeks, you both ask: Are more people buying? Are they asking about each other’s food or drink? If it’s helping, you can keep doing it or even plan a small promo together, like, “Buy a meat pie and get a small discount on juice.”







Idea 5: Build a WhatsApp Community Group





- Core Concept:




Instead of just adding people to one WhatsApp group, you can now create a WhatsApp Community. This helps you manage many groups in one place and makes it easier to send updates to all your customers.




If you run a small business in Ghana—whether it’s a boutique, food joint, or hair salon—this is a great way to connect with your regular customers, give them offers, and keep them coming back.




What Can You Do?




### Tool 1: Create a WhatsApp Community

- Men’s Wear



- Women’s Wear



- Discount Offers




How to Set It Up:





- Open WhatsApp



- Tap the Communities tab



- Tap New Community



- Add existing groups or create new ones based on your business needs







### Tool 2: Keep People Engaged

- Share helpful tips (e.g., “How to style Ankara”)



- Announce sales or new stock arrivals



- Post polls to collect feedback (e.g., “Which flavour do you prefer: mango or pineapple?”)




Real-Life Example:If you run a small food spot in Dansoman, ask your customers what combo they'd love for the Friday Special. Let them vote directly inside the group! 




Tips for Using WhatsApp Communities Well





- Only post useful stuff—don’t spam.



- Reply when people comment or ask questions.



- Show behind-the-scenes moments (e.g. how you package orders).



- Reward your active members with small discounts or shout-outs.

Bonus Tool 11: Make It Easy for Customers to Pay with MoMo and Digital Payments




Action:Let your customers know they can pay you through mobile money (MoMo), and make the process as simple as possible.




Why It Works:





- Many people in Ghana prefer to use MoMo—it’s fast, safe, and they don’t need to carry cash.



- When paying is easy, customers are more likely to buy from you again.



- Cashless payments also make your business look professional and trustworthy.




How to Do It:





- Clearly show your MoMo number on your flyers, Instagram page, WhatsApp status, or even write it neatly on your delivery bag or shop wall.



- Use payment links (like ExpressPay, Hubtel, or your bank app) so you can just send a link on WhatsApp for quick payment—no long instructions.



- Offer a small discount or bonus to people who pay by MoMo. For example:“Pay with MoMo and get GH₵2 off” or“Cashless customers get free delivery today.”




Real-Life Example:Let’s say you sell secondhand clothes online. Instead of waiting for someone to send you MoMo manually and then confirm, you send them a payment link they can click and pay in seconds. 




Or, if you sell food and offer delivery, you can say, “Pay by MoMo and get a free bottle of water.” It’s a small cost to you, but customers will appreciate it.









By consistently applying even a few of these low-cost strategies, you can effectively reach more customers, build stronger relationships, and grow your Ghanaian business without breaking the bank. Good luck!
